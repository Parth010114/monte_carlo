# Monte_Carlo Simulation for The Magnificent 7 stocks
"I employed Monte Carlo simulation to project stock prices, leveraging this data to anticipate the optimal allocation of weights for maximizing returns while minimizing risks. Additionally, I constructed an optimal portfolio utilizing diverse risk-return metrics such as the Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, I explored various techniques for assessing normality, such as Q-Q plots. I also examined the interrelationships among different assets through correlation and covariance matrices, aiding investors in crafting an optimal portfolio tailored to a specific risk-free rate."
